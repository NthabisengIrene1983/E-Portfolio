## 💬 My Work Readiness Journey

I am a student studying toward a Diploma in Information and Communication Technology at Cape Peninsula University of Technology. As part of my Work Readiness Training, I created this portfolio to reflect on my growth, experiences, and career goals. 

Through the various activities such as personality assessments, CV writing, and skills evaluations, I gained a deeper understanding of my strengths and weaknesses. I learned that I am detail-oriented, analytical, and passionate about solving problems.

What was challenging for me was expressing my skills in a CV and reflecting deeply on my own development. But I am proud of how far I’ve come in understanding my abilities, building confidence, and identifying a clear career direction. I now know what I’m passionate about, and I’m motivated to keep learning and improving.

#### 🧠 Reflection (STAR Technique)

> **S – Situation**  
As part of the PRP370S Work Readiness portfolio, I participated in a career counselling activity designed to help students explore and reflect on potential career paths in the ICT field.

> **T – Task**  
My task was to complete an assessment tool that would help me evaluate my personal strengths, interests, and career goals. The goal was to match these with possible ICT roles that suit my profile.

> **A – Action**  
I completed the career assessment by answering questions about my preferences, personality, and working style. After reviewing the results, I reflected on how each suggested role aligned with my academic background and personal interests. I also considered which skills I currently have and which I need to develop further.

> **R – Result**  
The assessment helped me recognize that I am well-suited for roles such as systems analyst, software tester, or data support technician — all of which require analytical thinking, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills. This activity gave me clarity about my direction and helped me focus on improving technical skills like SQL and systems thinking to prepare for future opportunities.
