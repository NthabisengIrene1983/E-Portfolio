## 💬 My Work Readiness Journey

I am currently pursuing a **Diploma in Information and Communication Technology** at the **Cape Peninsula University of Technology**. This e-portfolio serves as a comprehensive reflection of my personal and professional development journey throughout the **Work Readiness Training (PRP370S)**.

During this journey, I engaged in career readiness activities including **career counselling**, **skills and personality assessments**, **CV creation**, and **structured self-reflection**. These activities have helped me understand my professional strengths, develop career clarity, and enhance my confidence.

I discovered that I am a **detail-oriented**, **analytical thinker** with a strong passion for using technology to solve real-world problems. Initially, I found it challenging to articulate my skills on paper and conduct in-depth self-reflection. However, I have made significant progress and now have a clearer career vision aligned with my values and aspirations in the ICT sector.
